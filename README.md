# misc_smallpdf
needed a simpler way to compress scanned documents

long time ago found a bash script doing the same thing, 
lost it then found this python script
originally was named cpdf
it is very simple but half baked argument handling

from the original help:
 smallpdf help

This is a script to compress a pdf file with the convention of: cpdf [type: screen, ebook, printer, prepress, or default] [input file name] [output file name]. To learn more about the different types, use the "types" flag (ie. cpdf types)
